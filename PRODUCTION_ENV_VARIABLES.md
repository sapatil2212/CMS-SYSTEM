# üö® CRITICAL: Use PRODUCTION Environment Variables

## ‚ùå Problem Identified

You're using **LOCAL** environment variables in your Vercel deployment:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:swapnil2212@localhost:3306/cms_db"  # ‚ùå This is LOCAL
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"                           # ‚ùå This is LOCAL
```

**Vercel can't connect to `localhost` - that's why you're getting internal server errors!**

## ‚úÖ CORRECT Production Environment Variables

**Replace ALL your Vercel environment variables with these EXACT values:**

```bash
# ‚úÖ PRODUCTION Database (Railway)
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:HiIpumviyWmCJJvKpJwIKddQvikGvuAa@crossover.proxy.rlwy.net:26043/railway

# ‚úÖ PRODUCTION URL (Your Vercel deployment)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://cms-system-i8sq8dk44-sapatil2212s-projects.vercel.app

# ‚úÖ Production Auth Secret (Generate a new one for security)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-PROD-2024
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key-change-this-in-production-PROD-2024

# ‚úÖ Email Configuration (Keep the same)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME=saptechnoeditors@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=uyqhyiptjkarfgdq

# ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Cloudinary (You're missing these!)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=ddk4z10vi
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=985312945233712
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=E1pJh7HZR6Xaa04CqM4zmWcoMi8
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=ddk4z10vi

# ‚úÖ File Upload Settings
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
```

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS

### Step 1: Delete Current Variables
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. **DELETE ALL existing variables**

### Step 2: Add Production Variables
1. Add each variable above **exactly as shown**
2. Make sure to set them for **Production** environment
3. Double-check there are no extra spaces

### Step 3: Force Redeploy
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 4: Test Immediately
1. Go to `/admin/process`
2. Try opening any process
3. Should work without internal server errors

## üîç Key Differences

| Variable | ‚ùå Your Current (Local) | ‚úÖ Should Be (Production) |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| DATABASE_URL | `localhost:3306` | `crossover.proxy.rlwy.net:26043` |
| NEXTAUTH_URL | `http://localhost:3000` | `https://cms-system-i8sq...` |
| Cloudinary | Missing completely | All 4 variables required |

## üõ†Ô∏è Why This Will Fix Your Issues

1. **Database Connection**: Will connect to your Railway production database instead of localhost
2. **Image Uploads**: Cloudinary variables will enable image upload functionality
3. **Authentication**: Production URL will fix auth redirects
4. **API Routes**: All endpoints will have access to correct environment

## üìã Verification Checklist

After setting the correct variables:

- [ ] All environment variables deleted and re-added
- [ ] DATABASE_URL points to Railway (not localhost)
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL points to Vercel (not localhost) 
- [ ] All 4 Cloudinary variables are present
- [ ] Application redeployed
- [ ] `/admin/process` loads without errors
- [ ] Can open process edit modals
- [ ] Can upload images
- [ ] Can save content changes

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If you still get errors after this fix:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - Look for specific error messages

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open Developer Tools ‚Üí Console
   - Look for failed API calls

3. **Test Database Connection**:
   - The Railway database URL should work from anywhere

**Root Cause**: Using local development environment variables in production deployment.

**Solution**: Use production database and service URLs in Vercel environment variables.
