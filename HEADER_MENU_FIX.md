# Header Menu Items Fix

## Issue Description
After deployment on Vercel, the header menu items are not displaying. The header shows the logo, phone number, and user information, but the navigation menu items (Home, About, Processes, Base Metals, etc.) are missing.

## Root Cause
The header menu items are not being seeded in the production database. The API endpoint `/api/content/header-menu` returns an empty array `[]`, indicating that no menu items exist in the database.

## Solution

### Option 1: Quick Fix via API (Recommended)
Call the debug API endpoint to fix the menu items:

```bash
curl -X POST https://cms-system-v2.vercel.app/api/debug/fix-header-menu
```

Or visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://cms-system-v2.vercel.app/api/debug/fix-header-menu
```

### Option 2: Run the Fix Script Locally
If you have access to the production database, run:

```bash
node scripts/fix-header-menu.js
```

### Option 3: Update Seed File
The main seed file has been updated to include header menu items. For future deployments, the menu items will be automatically seeded.

## What the Fix Does

1. **Creates Default Menu Items:**
   - Home
   - About
   - Processes (with dropdown)
   - Base Metals (with dropdown)
   - Sectors (with dropdown)
   - Quality Testing
   - Contact

2. **Adds Dropdown Items:**
   - **Processes:** Silver Plating, Busbar Plating, Zinc Plating, Gold Plating, etc.
   - **Base Metals:** Aluminium, Copper, Stainless Steel, Carbon Steel, Brass
   - **Sectors:** Sectors Overview

3. **Ensures All Items Are Active:**
   - Sets `isActive: true` for all menu items
   - Activates any existing inactive items

## Verification

After running the fix, you can verify it worked by:

1. **Check the API:**
   ```bash
   curl https://cms-system-v2.vercel.app/api/content/header-menu
   ```
   Should return an array of menu items instead of `[]`

2. **Check the Website:**
   Visit the website and the header should now display all menu items with proper dropdowns.

## Files Modified

- `prisma/seed.ts` - Added header menu items seeding
- `prisma/seed-header-menu-items.ts` - Modified to export as default function
- `scripts/fix-header-menu.js` - Created fix script
- `app/api/debug/fix-header-menu/route.ts` - Created debug API endpoint

## Prevention

For future deployments, ensure that:
1. The seed script runs during deployment
2. Header menu items are included in the main seed file
3. Database migrations are properly applied
