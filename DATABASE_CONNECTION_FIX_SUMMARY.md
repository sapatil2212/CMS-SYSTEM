# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The CMS system was experiencing "Too many database connections opened: ERROR HY000 (1040): Too many connections" errors in production, preventing users from updating footer details and other content.

## Root Cause
Multiple API routes were creating individual `PrismaClient` instances instead of using a shared connection pool, causing database connection exhaustion in the serverless environment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Database Configuration (`lib/db.ts`)
- ✅ Added connection pooling configuration for serverless environments
- ✅ Added proper connection cleanup on process termination
- ✅ Added SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers for graceful shutdown
- ✅ Limited connection pool to 1 connection per instance for serverless

### 2. Fixed Critical API Routes
The following routes were updated to use the shared Prisma instance:

#### Visitor Tracking Routes
- ✅ `app/api/visitors/track/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/visitors/test/route.ts` (already fixed)
- ✅ `app/api/visitors/reset/route.ts` (already fixed)

#### Authentication Routes
- ✅ `app/api/auth/profile/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/auth/signup-otp/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/auth/profile-otp/route.ts`

#### Admin Routes
- ✅ `app/api/admin/activity-track/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/admin/users/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/admin/contact-submissions/route.ts`

#### Content Management Routes
- ✅ `app/api/content/process-activation/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/content/base-metal-activation/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/contact/submit/route.ts`

### 3. TypeScript Fixes
- ✅ Fixed `ModalType` export in `ConfirmationModal.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed `type="error"` → `type="danger"` in base metals page

## Before vs After

### Before (Problematic)
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'
```

## Database Configuration
The shared Prisma instance now includes:
- Connection pooling optimized for serverless
- Proper error handling and logging
- Graceful connection cleanup
- Connection limit of 1 per instance (suitable for serverless)

## Testing
- ✅ Created database connection test script
- ✅ All critical API routes now use shared instance
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors resolved

## Deployment Notes
1. The fixes are ready for deployment
2. Database connection issues should be resolved
3. Footer management and other content updates should work properly
4. Monitor connection logs in production for any remaining issues

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Monitor database connection logs
3. Test footer management functionality
4. Verify all content management features work correctly

## Files Modified
- `lib/db.ts` - Enhanced database configuration
- Multiple API route files - Updated to use shared Prisma instance
- `components/admin/ConfirmationModal.tsx` - Fixed type exports
- `app/admin/basemetals/page.tsx` - Fixed modal type
- `scripts/test-db-connection.js` - Added connection testing
- `scripts/fix-prisma-connections.js` - Automated fix script

The database connection issues should now be resolved, allowing users to properly update footer details and other content from the dashboard.
