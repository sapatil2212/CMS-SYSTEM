# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## üö® Critical Issues Found and Solutions

Based on the analysis of your CMS system, here are the main issues preventing content management from working on Vercel and their solutions:

## 1. Environment Variables Setup (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Issue
Environment variables for Cloudinary and database might not be properly configured in Vercel.

### Solution
Go to your Vercel dashboard and ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:HiIpumviyWmCJJvKpJwIKddQvikGvuAa@crossover.proxy.rlwy.net:26043/railway

# JWT & Auth
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://cms-system-i8sq8dk44-sapatil2212s-projects.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key-change-this-in-production

# Email
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME=saptechnoeditors@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=uyqhyiptjkarfgdq

# Cloudinary (CRITICAL for image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=ddk4z10vi
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=985312945233712
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=E1pJh7HZR6Xaa04CqM4zmWcoMi8
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=ddk4z10vi

# File Upload
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
```

### Steps to Set Environment Variables in Vercel:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with Name and Value
5. Make sure to add them for Production, Preview, and Development
6. Redeploy your application

## 2. Database Connection Issues

### Issue
The Railway database connection might have issues in production.

### Solution
1. Verify the DATABASE_URL is exactly: `mysql://root:HiIpumviyWmCJJvKpJwIKddQvikGvuAa@crossover.proxy.rlwy.net:26043/railway`
2. Ensure connection pooling is properly configured
3. Add connection timeout parameters if needed

## 3. Image Upload System

### Current Status: ‚úÖ CORRECT
Your image upload system is properly set up with Cloudinary, which is perfect for Vercel deployment. The issue is likely missing environment variables.

### What's Working:
- `/api/admin/upload` correctly uses Cloudinary
- `ImageUpload` component properly calls the upload API
- Hero slider works because it uses the same system

### What Needs to be Fixed:
- Ensure Cloudinary credentials are set in Vercel
- Verify the upload API can access these credentials

## 4. API Route Configuration

### Issue
Vercel might have timeout issues with API routes.

### Solution: ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED
Your `vercel.json` already has the correct configuration:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. Next.js Image Configuration

### Status: ‚úÖ CORRECT
Your `next.config.js` properly includes Cloudinary domains:
```javascript
images: {
  domains: ['localhost', 'images.unsplash.com', 'res.cloudinary.com'],
  unoptimized: true,
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Action Steps

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add all the variables listed above
3. Make sure they're enabled for Production

### Step 2: Redeploy
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Or push a small change to trigger a new deployment

### Step 3: Test the Fixes
1. Try uploading an image in the admin panel
2. Try updating process content
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check Vercel function logs for server errors

## üîç Debugging Steps

### If Image Uploads Still Fail:
1. Check Vercel function logs for Cloudinary errors
2. Verify Cloudinary credentials are correct
3. Test Cloudinary upload directly

### If Process Content Updates Fail:
1. Check Vercel function logs for database errors
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Test database connection

## üìã Testing Checklist

After implementing the fixes, test these features:

- [ ] Image upload in Hero Slider admin (already working)
- [ ] Image upload in Process content admin
- [ ] Process content text updates
- [ ] Process content saves properly
- [ ] Images display correctly on frontend
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No function errors in Vercel logs

## üÜò If Issues Persist

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - Check logs for specific error messages

2. **Browser Console:**
   - Open developer tools ‚Üí Console
   - Look for network errors or failed API calls

3. **Test Locally:**
   - Run the app locally with production environment variables
   - Ensure everything works locally first

## üìû Support

If you need additional help:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Check Vercel function logs for server-side errors
3. Verify all environment variables are exactly as specified above
