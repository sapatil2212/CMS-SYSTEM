# Database Connection Issue - Resolution

## Problem
The CMS system was experiencing "Too many database connections opened: ERROR HY000 (1040): Too many connections" errors, which prevented users from updating content and images in the Process Content Management system.

## Root Cause
Each API route was creating a new `PrismaClient` instance instead of using a shared instance. This caused the database to exceed its connection limit when multiple requests were made simultaneously.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Configuration (`lib/db.ts`)
- Updated to use proper connection pooling
- Added connection cleanup on process termination
- Added logging configuration for better debugging

### 2. Updated Environment Configuration (`env.example`)
- Added connection pooling parameters to DATABASE_URL:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:swapnil2212@localhost:3306/cms_db?connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=2"
  ```

### 3. Fixed All API Routes
Updated all API routes to use the shared Prisma instance instead of creating new ones:

**Before:**
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'
```

### 4. Routes Fixed
- All content API routes in `app/api/content/`
- All admin API routes in `app/api/admin/`
- All auth API routes in `app/api/auth/`
- Dynamic process routes in `app/api/content/[process]/`

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:swapnil2212@localhost:3306/cms_db?connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=2"

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-key-change-this-in-production"

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT="587"
EMAIL_USERNAME="saptechnoeditors@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="uyqhyiptjkarfgdq"

# File Upload Configuration
UPLOAD_DIR="public/uploads"
MAX_FILE_SIZE="5242880" # 5MB

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

### 2. Restart the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Fix
- Try updating content in the Process Content Management system
- Upload images and verify they appear instantly
- Check that multiple concurrent requests work without connection errors

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates "Too many connections" errors
- ✅ Improves performance with connection pooling
- ✅ Enables instant content updates and image uploads
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Proper connection cleanup

## Monitoring
The system now includes:
- Connection pooling with a limit of 5 connections
- 2-second timeout for connection requests
- Automatic connection cleanup on process termination
- Development logging for debugging

This should resolve the issues with content updates and image uploads not being reflected instantly on the frontend.
